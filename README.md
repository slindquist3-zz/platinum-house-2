AMEX London House Landing Page

### What is this repository for? ###

* This repo is the landing page for our collaboration with AMEX for the London House.

### Commands / Build Process ###


Since we're starting out with a new page and this project has very little JavaScript requirements (not much to compile or minify), I tried to lighten the amount of extra tools we were using.

Pretty much the only tool I've been using is node-sass, which you can run in the root directory of furthermore-microsites on this branch by entering in the command line:

* npm run watch-css

Run this in the root directory of the project. It will compile your scss into css as you code. After you refresh the browser you see the css changes that node-sass has compiled. I have just been opening the index file in the broswer, since I haven't had the need to run a server yet.
